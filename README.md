# LearnDex: An Interactive Uniswap V2 Learning Tool on Educhain

Welcome to **LearnDex**, an educational project designed to teach the fundamental concepts of Uniswap V2 through hands-on experience. This project is built on the Educhain platform, offering a unique environment where you can explore and interact with decentralized finance concepts in a practical way.

## Project Overview

LearnDex provides a practical environment where you can:

- **Mint Custom Tokens:** Create your own ERC-20 tokens to use within the LearnDex platform.
- **Create Liquidity Pools:** Establish liquidity pools with your custom tokens and explore how liquidity impacts trading.
- **Add Liquidity:** Contribute liquidity to existing pools, and learn about liquidity provider (LP) shares and impermanent loss.
- **Perform Swaps:** Execute token swaps and observe how the x*y=k formula determines the resulting prices.
- **Understand the x*y=k Formula:** Dive into the mathematical foundation of AMMs and see how liquidity and pricing interact.

## Educhain Platform

Unlike traditional local deployments, LearnDex is designed to operate on the Educhain platform. This means all interactions, including token minting, liquidity provision, and swaps, occur on Educhain rather than a local development environment. This setup provides a more realistic and secure environment for learning about decentralized finance and Automated Market Makers (AMMs).

## Getting Started

To begin using LearnDex on Educhain, follow these steps:

1. Access the Educhain platform.
2. Deploy the LearnDex smart contracts on Educhain.
3. Interact with the platform by minting tokens, creating pools, adding liquidity, and performing swaps directly on Educhain.

## Learning Objectives

By using LearnDex, you will gain practical experience and insights into:

- How Uniswap V2 operates and the role of liquidity pools.
- The process of minting tokens and providing liquidity.
- The dynamics of token swapping and how AMMs set prices.
- The implications of the x*y=k formula on pricing and liquidity.
